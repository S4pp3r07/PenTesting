# Upgrading a Non-Interactive Shell
### Validate Python Version

To ensure Python is installed and accessible, you can check its version using the following commands:
```shell
python -V 
python3 -V
```
Make sure to use the correct version of Python for the next commands!
```shell
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' 
SHELL=/bin/bash script -q /dev/null (if your machine does not have python)
```

## Upgrading the Terminal

### Background the Shell
To background the shell, press:
```ctrl + z```
### Bypassing the Local Interpreter
The next process will bypass your local interpreter (shell) so that your keystrokes will be sent to the reverse shell (victim) and not back to your machine. Execute the following command:
```
stty raw -echo; fg
```
### Reset Terminal
To reset the terminal, type:
```reset```
Then, specify the name of the terminal type:
```xterm-256color```
### Validate Terminal Type
Check the terminal type using:
```
echo $TERM
export TERM=xterm-256color
echo $TERM
```
### Validate Shell
Check the current shell type:
```
echo $SHELL
export SHELL=/bin/bash
echo $SHELL
```
### Validate Screen Size
Check the screen size:
```
echo $TERM && tput lines && tput cols  # (run on attacker)

stty rows 36 columns 110  # (run on victim)
```
*Note: When you run the second command, use the numbers obtained from the attacker's box. This ensures your shell size matches your local attack box.*
